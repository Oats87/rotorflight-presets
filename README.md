# Rotorflight Presets

A simple way to configure your Rotorflight Flight Controller Firmware settings.

See https://github.com/betaflight/firmware-presets for more information. There have been some changes made to the parser, but overall the same rules apply for building presets.

## Credits

The Preset system was developed by @limonspb for Betaflight 4.3 and ported by @Oats87 for the Rotorflight project.
